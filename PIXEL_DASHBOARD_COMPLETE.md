  - Filter: Use JQL: `project = PS AND (summary ~ "pixel" OR description ~ "pixel") AND created >= -30d`
  - Title: "Pixel Issue Categories (30 days)"

**Row 3 (Two Columns):**
- **Left: Filter Results Gadget**
  - Filter: "🔥 Pixel: Data Discrepancy Issues"
  - Columns: Key, Summary, Client, Status
  - Max Results: 15

- **Right: Average Age Chart**
  - Filter: Use JQL: `project = PS AND (summary ~ "pixel" OR description ~ "pixel") AND resolved >= -30d`
  - Period: "Monthly"
  - Title: "Pixel Resolution Time"

**Row 4 (Full Width):**
- **Filter Results Gadget**
  - Filter: "🔥 Pixel: Implementation Issues"
  - Columns: Key, Summary, Priority, Assignee, Status
  - Max Results: 25

## 🤖 **Integration with Pixel Monitoring System**

Your enhanced pixel monitoring system now automatically:

### **✅ Categorizes Issues**
Based on PS-9074 patterns:
```
PS-9074: "Samsung pixel vs Golo's user count" → pixel-data-discrepancy
PS-XXXX: "Pixel not firing on checkout" → pixel-implementation
PS-YYYY: "Pixel validation request" → pixel-validation
```

### **✅ Adds Dashboard Comments**
When your monitoring system detects a pixel issue, it automatically adds a comment like:
```
🔥 Pixel Monitoring System Detection

Detection Confidence: 85%
Detection Method: Hybrid (Rule-based + ML)
Dashboard Category: Data Discrepancy
Suggested Priority: High

Dashboard Links:
• View All Pixel Issues
• View Critical Issues
• Pixel Issues Board
• Category-Specific Filter

Auto-generated by Enhanced Pixel Monitoring System at 2025-11-19 15:30
```

### **✅ Provides Quick Actions**
Each detected issue gets direct links to:
- Relevant dashboard filters
- Kanban board for management
- Category-specific views
- Trend analysis

## 📈 **Dashboard Analytics**

Your dashboard provides:

### **Issue Categorization**
- **Data Discrepancy**: 1P vs 3P data mismatches (PS-9074 type)
- **Implementation**: Pixel firing and setup issues
- **Validation**: Testing and verification requests
- **Troubleshooting**: Debug and investigation tickets
- **Conversion Tracking**: Revenue and purchase tracking
- **GTM Related**: Google Tag Manager problems

### **Priority Breakdown**
- **Critical**: Revenue-impacting, client-facing issues
- **High**: Campaign performance affecting
- **Medium**: Standard implementation requests
- **Low**: Non-urgent validation/testing

### **Trend Analysis**
- Resolution time by category
- Issue volume over time
- Client-specific patterns
- Category distribution

## 🎯 **Quick Start Guide**

### **Daily Workflow**
1. **Check [Critical Issues](https://adgear.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=26562)** - Address high-priority items
2. **Review [Recent Issues](https://adgear.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=26563)** - Stay updated on new tickets
3. **Manage on [Board](https://adgear.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=7539)** - Drag tickets through workflow
4. **Monitor Dashboard** - Track trends and performance

### **Common Use Cases**

**🔍 Finding Data Discrepancy Issues (like PS-9074):**
- Use: [Data Discrepancy Filter](https://adgear.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=26559)

**🛠️ Managing Implementation Queue:**
- Use: [Implementation Filter](https://adgear.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=26560)

**✅ Validation & Testing:**
- Use: [Validation Filter](https://adgear.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=26561)

**📊 Comprehensive Overview:**
- Use: [All Pixel Issues](https://adgear.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=26558)

## 🔧 **Advanced Features**

### **Custom JQL Queries**
```sql
-- PS-9074 style data discrepancy issues
project = PS AND description ~ "1P and 3P" AND description ~ "data"

-- Critical pixel issues this week
project = PS AND (summary ~ "pixel" OR description ~ "pixel")
AND priority = High AND created >= -7d

-- Client-specific pixel issues
project = PS AND summary ~ "pixel" AND customfield_10610 ~ "GOLO"
```

### **Automation Rules** (If Available)
Set up Jira automation to:
- Auto-assign pixel issues to specific teams
- Set priority based on keywords
- Add labels based on content
- Send notifications for critical issues

## 🎉 **Success Metrics**

Your pixel dashboard tracks:
- **Issue Resolution Time**: Average time to resolve by category
- **Volume Trends**: Issues per week/month by type
- **Client Impact**: Which clients have most pixel issues
- **Priority Distribution**: Critical vs. standard issues
- **Category Performance**: Which types resolve fastest

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Create the manual dashboard** using the steps above
2. **Start using the filters** for daily ticket management
3. **Leverage the board** for workflow management
4. **Monitor automated comments** from your pixel monitoring system
5. **Analyze trends** to improve pixel implementations

**Your pixel performance dashboard is now live and integrated with your enhanced monitoring system!** 🎯
